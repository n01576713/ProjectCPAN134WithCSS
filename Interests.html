    <p class="inerP">I have a couple of interests. Firstly, I enjoy watching movies. Some of the movies that stand out to me are Interstellar, The Dark Knight, and 1917. I find these movies engaging and interesting.
        Secondly, I'm an athletic person. I have participated in various sports such as track, cross country, volleyball, and European handball. However, soccer is my main sport, and I have been playing it since the age of 6 at Brampton Youth Soccer Club. I even played rep for some time until Covid. Supporting Manchester United has been a significant influence on me, and I will always support this team through its ups and downs. My favourite soccer player is Wayne Rooney because he stood out to me as he was special. My favourite goal of his is his bicycle kick goal aganist Manchester City in 2011 as it was so important for the club.
        Thirdly, I enjoy playing video games, such as FIFA, Minecraft, and Microsoft Flight Simulator. I find these games as a way to disconnect from what's happening around me and relax. Except for FIFA because that game is not for relaxing.
        Finally, in high school, I took a class called Technology Design, where I developed woodworking skills and learned CAD. Some of the projects I completed included making a tray, a cabinet, and 3D designing.
